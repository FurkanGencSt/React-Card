I made this project based on the https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ course in the React learning phase. Therefore, it is not owned by me and is not original. It was something I did in terms of learning.


//This note for me;

git reset --mixed origin/main
git add .
git commit -m "This is a new commit for what I originally planned to be amended"
git push origin main
